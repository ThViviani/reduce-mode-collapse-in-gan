# ðŸ§ª Mode Collapse Mitigation in GANs

This project investigates various techniques to **reduce mode collapse** in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
The core component is the **RpGAN discriminator**, evaluated in combination with architectural modifications and regularization strategies.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Directions

- **RpGAN** â€“ discriminator with **relative-pairwise comparison** mechanism.
- **Autoencoder-based architectures** integrated into the GAN pipeline.
- **Latent-distance regularization** and other loss-based strategies.
- **Experiments on diverse datasets** to evaluate:
  - **Stability**
  - **Mode coverage**
  - **Sample quality**
